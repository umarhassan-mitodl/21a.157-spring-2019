Course Description
------------------

This course examines how a variety of cultural traditions approach and propose answers to the question of how to live a meaningful life. We consider the meaning of life, not as a philosophical abstraction, but as a matter with which individuals grapple in their daily lives and communities, facing difficult decisions between meeting and defying cultural expectations. The course aims to provide tools for thinking about moral and ethical decisions as social and historical practices, and permits students to compare and contextualize how people in different times and places approach fundamental — though not necessarily universal — questions to do with such topics as family, wealth, self-cultivation, sex, belonging, and powers beyond.
